# Dockerized MSX Fusion-C build environment 

_Gilbert François Duivesteijn_

## About

This repository creates a out-of-the-box consistent cross-platform MSX C-programming development environment for all computers with ARM and Intel processors. It runs on macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), Linux (ARM64 or x86_64) and Windows.

It uses:

- **Docker image**, based on Ubuntu 22.04
- **SDCC 4.0.0**, compiled from source and *z80.ref* patched for Fusion-C.
- **Hex2bin** tool, compiled from source and patched to make it work with gcc > 11.
- **Fusion-C 1.2** library, compiled from source, compatible with SDCC 4.0.0

Since all libraries are compiled from source, one gets native speed on all architectures. On your native host system, install [openMSX](http://openmsx.org) and the [editor](https://neovim.io) of your choice. You only compile the programs in the Docker container. You can edit the source files in the native host system in the editor that you prefer. Running and testing in openMSX happens also on your native operating system.



The location of the tools in the docker container are:

| Tool             | Location                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| sdcc             | /usr/local/bin/sdcc         |
| sdasz80          | /usr/local/bin/sdas80       |
| sdcc libraries   | /usr/local/share/sdcc       |
| hex2bin          | /usr/local/bin/hex2bin      |
| Fusion-C include | /usr/local/fusion-c/include |
| Fusion-C library | /usr/local/fusion-c/lib     |
| Fusion-C header  | /usr/local/fusion-c/header  |

Use these locations in your Makefile. See the example in this project 



## Installation

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on your system if you don't have that yet. Then open a terminal and run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

At first time, it builds the docker image and compiles SDCC, Hex2bin and Fusion-C. That will take some time. The next time, the startup will be super fast. When you want to close your docker container, run:

```sh
docker compose down
```



## Using the development environment

- `docker compose up`: Start the docker container.
- Use the editor that you like, place the source files in `/src`
- `docker exec [container-id] [command]` : 
    + `docker exec msx-c-toolchain-dev-1 make`': Run **make**
    + `docker exec msx-c-toolchain-dev-1 make clean`': Run **make clean**
- `/dsk/[artefact]`: Test in openMSX on the host your compiled artefact (bin, rom, com)
- `docker compose down`: Stop the docker container when you're done developing.



## Easy shortcuts

I higly recommend installing [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and edit the file `Justfile` to your likings. As an example, instead of typing the full command `docker exec [container_id] [command]`, you can shorten it to:

```sh
just clean   # make clean
just make    # make
```

And starting openMSX and testing your program would be like:

```sh
just run 
```



## Random notes

​	At the moment, Fusion-C 1.2 is compatible with SDCC up to version 4.0.0. Higher versions of SDCC are incompatible due to a breaking change in the bundled assembler. 

​	Patching sdcc's `z80.ref` library is needed, because functions like printf and putchar are not compatible with MSX. Fusion-C provides own implementations for these functions. The patch is implemented in *Dockerfile*.
